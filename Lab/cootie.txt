Make sure you read all the way to the bottom.

Notice that my rules are different from Wikipedia.

You HAVE to use my rules, not the rules on Wikipedia, to get ANY credit.

Generate a random number from 1 to 7 and use it to pick which part to add.
Write the logic that completes the following table:
If the Roll is:	You can add this Body Part	if you already have this part	Maximum Number you may have.  Also the number required to finish the cootie
 1	Body	none	1
 2	Head	Body	1
 3	Antenna	Head	2
 4	Wings	Body	2
 5	Stinger	Body	1
 6	Legs	Body	4
7	Eyes	Head	6
Add a loop around the above logic.  Have the loop end when the cootie is completed.  To make sure the loop around the whole program is correct and will eventually end; you'll need to keep track of what parts have rolled already and how many of have been rolled.  Create counters (int numLegs=0;) and increment (numLegs++) them when appropriate. (if (roll==1) {numBody=1;} )
With all that done, change the if so that you can only place pieces if the prerequisites are met.  To add a leg, you need to have a body and the right dice roll. The code will look similar to:
if (roll == 6 && numBody == 1)
{
    numLegs ++;
}
Consider what to do with the maximum number too.  Your comments do not have to match mine.
Dice roll is a 5
No body, can't add a stinger :(
Cootie so far 0 body, 0 head, 0 antenna, 0 wings, 0 stingers, 0 legs, 0 Eyes

Dice roll is a 1
Yeah, you can add the body!
Cootie so far 1 body, 0 head, 0 antenna, 0 wings, 0 stingers, 0 legs, 0 Eyes

Dice roll is a 1
You already have a body :(
Cootie so far 1 body, 0 head, 0 antenna, 0 wings, 0 stingers, 0 legs, 0 Eyes

Dice roll is a 2
Yeah, you got the head!
Cootie so far 1 body, 1 head, 0 antenna, 0 wings, 0 stingers, 0 legs, 0 Eyes

Dice roll is a 6
Yeah, you got a leg!
Cootie so far 1 body, 1 head, 0 antenna, 0 wings, 0 stingers, 1 legs, 0 Eyes

Dice roll is a 6
Yeah, you got a leg!
Cootie so far 1 body, 1 head, 0 antenna, 0 wings, 0 stingers, 2 legs, 0 Eyes

and so on.

The overview of your code may look like:

while (cootie isn't completed)

{

      get the input

      if (the input is a 1)

     {

          do the work to add a body

     }

 

     if (the input is a 2 and we can add a head)

     {

          do the work to add a head

     }

    (add the rest of the body parts)

}

Now make it so that you can play many games of cootie over and over again:  (Include the number of rolls that were required to make the cootie)
